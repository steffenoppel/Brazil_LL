# Analysis of bycatch mitigation in Brazilian longline fleet.

Analysis of bycatch data requested by the Albatross Task Force / BirdLife International Marine Programme to quantify the reduction in seabird bycatch in the Brazilian longline fishing fleet with the adoption of two ACAP-recommended bycatch-mitigation measures, namely tori lines and night setting.

This analysis will be based on a similar analysis in the Namibian fleet that was published in [Da Rocha et al. 2021](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320720309733), but with the addition of a proportional night setting variable, indicating what proportion of the hooks were set in darkness.

Data were provided by Dimas Gianuca via Yann Rouxel.
